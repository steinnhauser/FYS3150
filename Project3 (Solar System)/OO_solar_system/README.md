# Object Oriented Solar System
The main.cpp file is set to initialize a solar system with initial values in the file "./data/initial_values.txt". The solar system will be simulated using the total time T and time step dt in main.cpp. Construct the executable file and run it by:
```
$ make -j
$ ./test.x
```
Then the results can easily visualized by running:
```
$ python3 plot.py
```
In the plot.py program, it can be specified to plot a static plot or an animation.
