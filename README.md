# FYS3150
Computational Physics public repository. The projects are written as a collaboration of Steinn Hauser and Simen Haapnes. There are five projects:
* Project 1: Poisson's equation in one dimension (Thomas algorithm and LU decomposition)
* Project 2: Quantum mechanics - two electrons in a harmonic oscillator well (eigenvalue problems)
* Project 3: Simulation of the solar system in 3D (Velocity Verlet method)
* Project 4: Ising model in two dimensions (Metropolis algorithm - MCMC)
* Project 5: Diffusion equation - heat diffusion in the lithosphere (Jacobi algorithm)
